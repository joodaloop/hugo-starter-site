description: A better starter template for Hugo sites.

This is contentious, but I don't think people should be using standardised theme systems for their sites. 

You cannot separate content and presentation that cleanly. Not every theme will be designed to work with the kind of site you want, and it's best to accept this rather than shrink yourself to fit within the most general theming patterns available. 

If you want two kinds of content pages, build a site that allows for that. If you want a custom home page layout, you're going to have to create it yourself. If you want to add sidenotes, you can't rely on the theme aithor to anticipate that demand. 

*Or hire me to do it.* 

Yes, I'm going to use this as a place to shill my own service ([WEBCRAFT](https://webcraft.joodaloop.com)), because it is part of why I put this template together. I design and develop personal sites for people. I'm pretty good at this, and not ridiculously expensive. 

**And I use Hugo a lot.**

I create brand new Hugo sites every time I start a new project. They don't have theme directories, everything importatnt lives in top-level folders. This is the simplest possible structure for a site, and the reason this template exists.

#### I wanted something that I could clone, open, and start editing instantly.

– No messing around with layout pages formats. The essential files (including a [taxonomy template](/tags/internet)) are already there, ready to be edited.

– No pasting in Lorem Ipsum placeholders, example posts already exist.

– An intuitive folder structure for stylesheets, scripts, fonts, media, and content. There's a place for everything, and the essential things are already in their place. 

– Dynamic meta tags, social media cards, and a simple config file for the whole site. 

*I've tried to follow the Hugo best practices as much as possible, but make some modifications for the sake of efficiency and ergonomics.*
