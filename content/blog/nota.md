title: Using Nota for Markdown

There aren't actually that many nice places to write markdown in. Plain-text editors get messy when you have a bunch of long links and asterixes everywhere. Even with syntax-highlighting with extensions, plain Markdown isn't the nicest to look at. 

You can use something like [Bear](https://bear.app) (which I love), or [Spaces](https://spaceswriting.com/), but those store files in their own data formats and only allow for *exporting* in Markdown, not editing local files. They try to be "note-taking apps", not text editors. 

Enter [Nota](https://nota.md/), a really cleanly-desingned markdown editor that only works with local files.

Sure, there are a bunch of other Markdown editors out there, but none of them are as polished as Nota. Nor do they have the excellent command palette, or the entire range of handy features:

- Multiple cursors
- Fuzzy search
- Multiple workspaces
- Custom commands through extensions
