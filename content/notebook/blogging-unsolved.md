The job of serving text over the internet, with complete control over structure and representation, has yet to be accomplished as well as it theoretically could be. 

It should be fast, cheap, and easily accessible to non-technical users. Block editors are okay, but pure text is faster and more portable. It's also free to host static files on most platforms, and databases are slow anyway.

I think the best way to get close to what I want is to build a platform on top of Hugo. It has the fastest build process, and templates are written in HTML and it's templating language that has a ton of useful functions built in. 

IDK though, maybe I should let people bring in React and stuff too.
